## ðŸ”„ Refactoring Target

**What code needs refactoring?**
<!-- Specific files, functions, or modules -->
<!-- Example: src/auth.py login() function -->

**Current Issues:**
<!-- What problems does this refactoring address? -->
- Code complexity
- Performance issues
- Maintainability concerns
- Technical debt

## ðŸ“‹ Planning Pipeline

### Current State Analysis
<!-- Current code metrics, complexity, etc. -->

### Refactoring Plan
<!-- Step-by-step refactoring approach -->
<!-- Preserve behavior, keep diffs small -->

### Tests Contract
<!-- Existing tests that must continue passing -->
<!-- New tests for refactored code -->

### Risk Assessment
<!-- Potential for introducing bugs -->
<!-- Areas that might be affected -->

### Success Criteria
<!-- Measurable improvements -->
<!-- Performance benchmarks, complexity reduction -->

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Benefits

**Quantitative:**
- Cyclomatic complexity reduction: Current â†’ Target
- Performance improvement: X% faster
- Lines of code reduction: -Y lines

**Qualitative:**
